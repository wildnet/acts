ACTS 1.3b3+wildNET
==========

Another Calendar-based Tarsnap Script.

Introduction
------------

`acts` is a minimal shell script that creates backups with Tarsnap. Our
design goals:

-   Just backup, no restore.
-   Calendar-based backup schedule
-   Portable, small, code footprint.

One Tarsnap archive is created per-target per-run. 31 daily, 12 monthly,
and indefinite yearly backups are kept.

Download
--------

You can use the development version of `acts` by cloning this
repository, or [download the latest stable
release](https://github.com/alexjurkiewicz/acts/releases/latest).

Usage
-----

1.  Take `acts.conf.sample`, customise it for your environment, and save
    it to `/etc/acts.conf` or `/usr/local/etc/acts.conf`.
2.  Run `acts` daily from cron.

Notes on behaviour:

-   `acts` creates archives of the form
    `<hostname>-<period>-yyyy-mm-dd_HH:MM:SS-target`.
-   Archives are created using the following logic:
    -   If no yearly backup for the current year exists, create a yearly
        backup.
    -   If no monthly backup for the current month exists, create a
        monthly backup.
    -   Otherwise, create a daily backup.
-   Archives are deleted using the following logic:
    -   If any backups failed, delete nothing.
    -   Keep the most recent 31 daily backups, and delete any older
        ones.
    -   Keep the most recent 12 monthly backups, and delete any older
        ones.
    -   Do not delete any yearly backups.

TODO
----

-   Add per-directory excludes handling. (For now, add global excludes
    in your `tarsnap.conf` or `.tarsnaprc` file.)
-   Add some backup period configurability. (For now, you can edit the
    hardcoded values in the script.)
